## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Tunable Permittivity Physics

The system exploits controlled Casimir forces between metamaterial layers to dynamically modify effective permittivity. The fundamental relationship follows:

```
ε_eff(ω,d,φ) = ε_matrix + Δε_Casimir(d) + Δε_field(φ) + Δε_quantum(ω)
```

Where:
- d is the interlayer separation distance
- φ represents applied field phase
- ω is the electromagnetic frequency
- Δε_Casimir captures Casimir-induced permittivity changes

### 1.2 Enhanced Casimir Permittivity Coupling

#### Ghost Condensate Field Dynamics
The ghost condensate effective field theory provides:

```
ℒ_ghost = P(X) - V(φ) - J_μ ∂^μ φ
```

Where P(X) is the kinetic function and X = -½(∂φ/∂t)² + ½(∇φ)².

#### Stress-Energy Tensor Formulation
The complete stress-energy tensor includes polymer corrections:

```
T_μν = ∂ℒ/∂(∂_μφ) ∂_ν φ - η_μν ℒ + T_μν^polymer
```

With polymer modifications:
```
T_00^polymer = ½[sin²(μπ)/μ² + (∇φ)² + m²φ²]
```

#### Einstein Field Equations with Electromagnetic Coupling
The coupled system follows:

```
G_μν = 8πT_μν = 8π(T_μν^matter + T_μν^EM + T_μν^Casimir)
```

Where T_μν^EM represents the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor.

### 1.3 Multi-Physics Coupling Framework

The permittivity evolution follows coupled multi-physics dynamics:

```
dε_eff/dt = f_coupled(E_fields, B_fields, T_thermal, ρ_material, φ_ghost, U_control, W_uncertainty, t)
```

With domain coupling through:
- **EM-Material**: Maxwell stress tensor coupling
- **Thermal-EM**: Temperature-dependent permittivity
- **Quantum-EM**: Ghost field perturbations
